						All functionality of the site is mirrored through the Api. To access POST functionality you must
						include an authentication token, which is available in the {% if session.logged_in %}<a
							href="/settings"><i>settings</i></a>{% else %}<i>settings</i>{% endif %} page of your
						account. GET requests can be freely made in most cases for debugging purposes--the server
						response will echo your request.

								Requests are echoed in a uniform format. <kbd>Route</kbd> is the url extension to which the request
								is send. <kbd>Token</kbd> is the user supplied token, which should be placed in the request header.
								If the token is placed in the request parameters instead of the header, a message is
								returned informing the user of this fact. <kbd>Keys</kbd> are simply the request parameter keys, in
								the same way <kbd>Values</kbd> are parameter values. These attributes are not modified in any way
								from the originating request and are simply present to allow users to test and debug
								their functions. <kbd>Message</kbd> is a simple response from the server informing the user of any
								potential issues with their request.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col">
							<h5 class="card-title">POST</h5>
							<p>
								Requests will return a boolean response indicating whether or not the supplied token is
								valid. <kbd>Token</kbd> should be placed in the request header, although validation will still be
								attempted if placed in the parameters. However, for all other routes the token should be
								placed in the header, and requests differing from this format will not be accepted.
